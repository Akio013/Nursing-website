<title>Types of Injection and Sites</title>
<body style="background-color:white;">

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Type of Injections and Sites</h1>
<p>An injection is a way of administering a liquid to a person using a needle and syringe. It’s also sometimes also called a ‘shot’ or ‘jab’. Injections are used to give a wide variety of different medications, such as insulin, vaccines and Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), but not all injections are the same.

Read on to learn more about the four most common types of injection and where on the body they should be given.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">What are the different type of injections?</h1>
<p>When ‘type’ of injection is mentioned, ‘type’ usually refers to the body tissue or path by which a medication is injected. The ‘type’ of injection describes its route of administration.

<p>The four most frequently used types of injection are:

<h3>Intravenous (IV) injections :</h3>

<ul>
<li>An IV injection is the fastest way to inject a medication and involves using a syringe to inject a medication directly into a vein.</li>
<li>IV infusion or drip involves using a pump or gravity to infuse the medication into a vein.</li>
<li>IV infusions allow a set amount of medication to be administered in a controlled manner over a period of time.</li>
<li>An IV catheter is most commonly placed into a vein in the forearm, back of the hand, antecubital fossa, ankle-close to the foot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">Intramuscular (IM) injections :</h3>

<ul>
<li>IM injections are given deep into a muscle where the medication is then absorbed quickly by surrounding blood vessels.</li>
<li>An IM injection os most commonly given into thigh (vastus lateralis b/w the hip and knee) ; buttocks (ventrogluteal muscle) ; upper arm (deltoid muscle).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subcutaneous (SC) injections :</h3>
<ul>
<li>SC injections are injected into the innermost layer of the skin called the subcutis or hypodermis, which is made up of a network of fat and collagen cells.</li>
<li>SC injections are also known as ‘subcut’ or ‘SQ’ injections.</li>
<li>These injections work more slowly than an IV or IM injection because the area does not have such a rich blood supply.</li>
<li>Recommended sites for an SC injection are lower abdomen, front or outer sides of thighs, upper area of buttock, upper outer area of arms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intradermal (ID) injections :</h3>
<ul>
<li>ID injections are given directly into the middle layer of the skin called the dermis. This type of injection is absorbed more slowly again than IV, IM or SC injections.</li>
<li>Recommended sites for an ID injection are inside or ventral aspect of forearm, upper back under the shoulder blade.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other types of injections include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Intra-articular injections : into a joint</li>
<li>Peri-articular injections : into the soft tissue close to a joint</li>
<li>Intraosseous injections : into the bone marrow</li>
<li>Intradetrusor injections : into the muscle in the wall of the bladder</li>
<li>Intraocular (or) intravitreal : into the jelly-like fluid in the eye</li>
<li>Intraperitoneal injections : given within the abdominal cavity</li>
<li>Intracardiac injections : into the muscle or ventricles of the heart</li>
<li>Intracavernous injections : into the base of the penis</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Where is the best place to get an injection?</h1>
<p>The best site on your body to receive an injection depends on factors such as the medication being given, what you are treating, how quickly or slowly the medication needs to work, and the type of injection you are receiving. The best type of injection for you may also be influenced by your weight, age, cost, the frequency of administration and other factors.</p>

<h2>Where can intravenous injections be administered?</h2>
<p>An IV injection is usually given by a healthcare professional. A small plastic tube called a catheter is typically inserted into the vein for an IV injection to be administered through, especially when more than one injection is required. IV catheters are best placed where they are easy to access and the blood flow is good. Furthermore, When selecting a site to place an IV catheter it’s important to avoid infected areas of skin and placing a catheter in a flexible joint where it may bend. Injured or sore areas, and stiff or very thin veins should also be avoided.</p>

<h2>Where can intramuscular injections be administered?</h2>
<p>Usually an IM injection, such as a vaccine, will be given by a healthcare professional. IM injections need to be injected into a muscle. It is recommended that an IM injection is given into a muscle in your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thigh - vastus lateralis muscle between the hip and knee</li>
<li>Bottom - Ventrogluteal muscle just below the hip on the side of the body</li>
<li>Upper arm - deltoid muscle between the top of the shoulder and the arm pit</li>
</ul>
<p>The best site for your IM injection may vary depending on the drug you are receiving. Some IM injections need to be administered into a larger muscle than the deltoid for example. When selecting an injection site for an IM injection it’s important to pick one that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A safe distance from the surrounding nerves, bones and large blood vessels</li>
<li>Large enough for the amount of medication</li>
<li>Not the site of an injury, abscess, or dying skin</li>
<li>Not a muscle that is emaciated or atrophied</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people may need to administer an IM injection at home.</p>
<h2>Where can subcutaneous injections be administered?</h2>
<p>If you’re prescribed an injection that you have to administer yourself at home then it’s likely it’ll be a SC injection. This type of injection is used to administer medications like insulin for diabetes, hormone injections for fertility treatment and blood thinning agents to prevent blood clots.</p>
<p>SC injections need to be injected into an area on the body with subcutaneous fat. It is recommended that you inject a SC injection into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower abdomen (belly or stomach area), except for the 2 inches (5cm) area around the navel (belly button)</li>
<li>The front or outer sides of the thighs</li>
<li>The upper area of the buttock</li>
<li>The upper outer area of the arms (if being administered by someone else)</li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting an injection site take care to avoid areas where the skin is sunken or lumpy, or areas where you might inject into a muscle rather than subcutaneous tissue. Also avoid sites where the skin is injured or damaged.</p>
<h2>Where can intradermal injections be administered?</h2>
<p>ID injections are commonly used for allergy and TB testing. The most common sites for an ID injection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inside or ventral aspect of the forearm</li>
<li>Upper back, under the shoulder blade</li>
</ul>
<p>When administering an ID injection for allergy testing it is best to avoid areas of the body with moles, scars, rashes or a lot of hair as they can make it difficult to interpret the results of testing. Skin lesions should also be avoided except when an ID injection is being administered to help treat them, such as in the case of steroid injections for psoriasis plaques.</p>
